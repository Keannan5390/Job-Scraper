Job-Scraper
===========

This is a php application initially created in 2010. It was part of a research project to determine the available job positions within the IT Job Sector in Central Wisconsin.

This has been sitting on my harddrive waiting to be updated to be a more robust and reusable set of libraries. It's time that starts. This is all of the original source, mainly a dump from my file system. I\'ll clean it up eventually so it is just the source.

Currently, it scrapes posted job positions from CareerBuilder, The Central Wisconsin Job Board, Indeed, and emails from Mid-State Technical College. I'd like to see it contain mapping configuration to map a response to specific attiributes needed by the system.
