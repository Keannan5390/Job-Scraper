				<p><strong>Project Overview</strong></p>
				<p>The goal of this project is to measure the health and needs of Information Technology (IT) 
					in various parts of Wisconsin, including the service areas for The Community Foundation of 
					Greater South Wood County, Midstate Technical College, and Wisconsin's 9th District for the 
					Department of Workforce Development.</p>
				<p>To accomplish these goals, we plan to start with job data from <a href="http://www.indeed.com">Indeed.com</a>, 
					a job agreggator site to determine current demand for employees where IT is a core part of their function 
					within an organization. We also plan to look at national and international trends by comparing that data 
					to job postings on <a href="http://jobscrape.drewfrisk.com/index2.php">odesk.com</a>.</p>
				<p>We hope that this information will help inform employees and job candidates about the skills 
					necessary to be succesful in the field. We expect that we might be able to inform local employers 
					on current trends in the industry. And we expect to also inform educators so that they may continue 
					to prepare well-trained graduates for the workforce.</p>

				<p>The interactive view of the jobs database will allow you to view the original/source post of the job description as well as filter the jobs by:<br />
					-Company <br />
					-Job Category <br />
					-Associated Skills <br />
					All of these values are stored in our database to be used for analyisis.</p>
				<p>This is currently a prototype of the analysis. The links provided on the table allow for basic queires of single parameters.
					Some jobs do not have skills listed with them.  These particular entires have problems communicating with the HTML DOM parser that we are using.
					We are working on solving this problem, however temporarily they will not have skills listed.  
					<br />Eventually, this will incorperate the ability for selecting multiple categories, companies, and/or skills. </p>
